#    This script executes the steps from the protein-protein-interaction pipeline of Tikk et al. (scripts/ppi-benchmark/Documentation/kernels-howto.pdf, (Tikk et al., 2010. A comprehensive benchmark of kernel methods to extract protein-protein interactions from literature. PLoS Comput. Biol).
#    In case of the shallow linguistic kernel approach, only the syntactic tree parse is needed, which will be generated within the first make-experiment step. To compare this method with the all-paths graph kernel approach, the cross-validation files are copied from the all-path graph kernel folder.
#    The make-experiment steps contain 10-fold cross validation runs with different parameter selections and the uploading process of the results to a PostgreSQL database. Please, read the CPI-Pipeline documentation to find out how to configure the database and how to modifiy the configuration files before running this script.
